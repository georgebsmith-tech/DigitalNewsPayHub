        Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from
        other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may

            any
            time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that
            information.
